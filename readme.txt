The first WordPress plugin that uses the latest facebook normes, to display facebook comments on your blog.

== Description ==

Two weeks ago we decide to replace the default WordPress comments with facebook social plugin, so at this step everything is clear except that for example; we can't show the latest comments (posted by facebook) in the sidebar, because that facebook social plugin is iframed, means comments are outside website, and thats generate SEO problems.
